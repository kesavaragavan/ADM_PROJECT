Air Quality Classification project will help us to understand pollution in various the Cities present in INDIA.
All the place in within year frame from 2015 to 2020 pollution trends can be understood. Moreover, Effective Fuzzy Inference System is implemented.
  
## Dataset <h4>
Dataset source : https://www.kaggle.com/rohanrao/air-quality-data-in-india 
Dataset Consist of Air Quality Data at hourly and daily bases recording from 2015 to 2020.
  

## AQI <h4>

AQI |	Associated Health Impacts
----|----------------------------
Good (0–50)	|Minimal impact
Satisfactory (51–100)|	May cause minor breathing discomfort to sensitive people.
Moderately polluted (101–200)|	May cause breathing discomfort to people with lung disease such as asthma, and discomfort to people with heart disease, children and older adults.
Poor (201–300)|	May cause breathing discomfort to people on prolonged exposure, and discomfort to people with heart disease.
Very poor (301–400)|	May cause respiratory illness to the people on prolonged exposure. Effect may be more pronounced in people with lung and heart diseases.
Severe (401–500)|	May cause respiratory impact even on healthy people, and serious health impacts on people with lung/heart disease. The health impacts may be experienced even during light physical activity.
----------------------------------

Building an effective system will helps to understand level of severity all cities are facing through.
